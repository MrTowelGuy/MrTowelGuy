### ðŸ¥³Hello there!!ðŸ¥³

**About me!**
---
Growing up I had a very creative upbringing from both sides of my family. I grew up playing music and making visual art, and eventually became a touring musician and a hairdresser in my late teen years. I have always had a passion for creativity and socializing. Dabbling in multiple career fields before, I recently was nudged by some peers to try for the IT field. Taking the idea and making it an amazing reality, I have loved every second of what I have learned and created! I am very excited to say that I am a recent General Assembly graduate, and i'm so excited to get out and show the world what i'm able to accomplish!
